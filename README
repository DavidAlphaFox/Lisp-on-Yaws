To run:

Configure/Make LFE and Yaws in '3rdparty' directories, using appropriate directives.

Install CLERIC via quicklisp. 
	Currently working with 2011-06-19, does not work with 2011/07/30 as of 2011/08/02.
In main directory run:
./erlcompile
./yawstart

in the resulting erlang terminal, run 
ybed_sup:start_link().

Go to the common lisp directory and open 'yaws_embed.lisp'.

Go to the examples directory and open 'examples.lisp' in an emacs session.

start slime

(ql:quickload "CLERIC") in the resulting terminal.

Edit the setfs at the top of examples.lisp so that they match your computer's configuration.
(Specifically the cookie path, and the yaws node computer name).

Compile and load yaws_embed and examples lisp files. (In that order).
Type (init) into the repl and press enter.
Type (add-math-appmod) into the repl and press enter.

If everything went well:
 you should be able to visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/hello_world in a web browser and get 'hello world'
 you should be able to visit http://0.0.0:8080/math/+/2/3/ and get '5'.

If everything did not go well... let me know!
