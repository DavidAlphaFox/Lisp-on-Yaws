Included projects (Yaws and LFE) are subject to their respective copyrights.

To run:

Configure/Make LFE and Yaws in '3rdparty' directories, using appropriate directives.

Install CLERIC via quicklisp. 
	Currently working with 2011-06-19, does not work with 2011/07/30 as of 2011/08/02.
In main directory run:
./erlcompile
./yawstart
in the resulting erlang terminal, run 
ybed_sup:start_link().
Go to the common lisp directory open
'yaws_embed.lisp' and 'examples.lisp' in an emacs session.
start slime
(ql:quickload "CLERIC") in the resulting terminal.
Edit the defparameters at the top of yaws_embed.lisp so that they match your computer's configuration.
(Specifically the cookie path, and the yaws node computer name).
compile and load yaws_embed and examples lisp files. (In that order).
type (init) into the repl and press enter.
type (add-math-appmod) into the repl and press enter.

If everything went well, you should be able to visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/hello_world in a web browser and get 'hello world', you should be able to visiti http://0.0.0:8080/math/+/2/3/ and get '5'.
